        <p style="font-size: 1.25em;"><em>"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</em> - Jesus Christ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2018:18" target="_blank">(Matthew 28:19-20)</a></p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1em">When Jesus commanded his eleven disciples according to the Great Commission, he was challenging them that it was <span class="text-uppercase">now</span> their time to be leaders. In addition, he was saying to make biblical leaders of <span class="text-uppercase">all</span> cultures. These disciples had just spent three years learning how to minister to people like Jesus with <strong><em>the purpose of one day being leaders</em></strong>. Not just any kind of leader, but biblically-sound, loving leaders who will serve anyone desiring the Good News.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1em"> Within Impact, we prepare our students over the course of three years, maximum, by placing them in leadership roles. These roles give practical experience in leading an organization - our organization by developing our ministry as training grounds to address today's real-world issues using biblical methods. Skills attained and polished include, but are not limited to, strategic planning, facilitating discussions, organizing community service, establishing professional networks, experiencing mission trips, active listening, communicating with understanding, becoming health-conscious, increasing academic achievements and GPA, maximizing their gifts, and, most importantly, being a role model especially for their peers. We group life skills with academic importance, the Gospel, and progressive thinking using practical resources and opportunities to ensure our next leaders are ready for the world upon graduation.
        
        <h2 class="text-center">We would <em>LOVE</em> to have you join our Leadership Team! If you are interested in being a Leader, please contact one of our student leaders via email: <a href="mailto:impactbison@gmail.com">impactbison@gmail.com</a></h2>
