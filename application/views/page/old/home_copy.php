	<h1>Welcome to the Impact Movement at Howard University</h1>
	<p>
		We warmly welcome you to our family! 
		We, the Impact Movement branch of biblical activists at Howard University, exist to advance God's Kingdom forward.
		In doing so, we honor our past, appreciate our present, and pray for our future.
		<blockquote>
			<p>"...we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,
				the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty's hand. BUT even
				if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods..."
			</P>
			<footer>
				<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203&version=NIV" target="_blank">Daniel 3:16-18</a>

	<h2>Honoring our Past
		<small>
			<br/>"Any words of wisdom...were spoken by those before us. We just need to listen." 
			<br/>- Douglas Frederick
		</small>
	</h2>
	<p>
		A huge part of the reason why we have the opportunities that we have today is due to our past heroes. Many of them were
		a part of powerful organizations on the front of fighting nonviolently the injustices, inequalities, and unbalanced liberties
		of this great nation. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the 
		<abbr title="Congress of Racial Equality">C.O.R.E.</abbr>, 
		<abbr title="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee">S.N.C.C.</abbr>, 
		and more.
	</p>
	<p>	
		We, a branch of the national Impact Movement, feel fortunate to continue making contributions to the founding values 
		of implementing reconciliation in our nation through biblical thought-inspiring speech and non-violent actions.
	</p>

	<h3>C.O.R.E.</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/congress-of-racial-equality" target="_blank">
			C.O.R.E. stands for the Congress of Racial Equality. 
		</a>
		We are thankful for C.O.R.E.
	</p>

	<h3>S.N.C.C.</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/sncc" target="_blank">
			S.N.C.C. stands for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. 
		</a>
		We are thankful for S.N.C.C.
	</p>

	<h2>Appreciating our Present</h2>
	<p>
		Today is a gift. One that we enjoy. One that we also take responsibility for.
		<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+12%3A48&version=NLT" target="_blank" class="verse">
			Luke 12:4
		</a> 
		reminds us that "too whom much is given, much is required."
	</p>
	<p>
		We understand our time to be one of the most precious gifts along with the current liberties handed to us all.
		Gifts and liberties that we don't take for granted and consider as privileges provided by God. As such, 
		we do our best to share these privileges along with the understanding and joy of such privileges with all our
		brothers and sisters. 
		<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A26&version=NIV" target="_blank" class="verse">
			1 Corinthians 12:26
		</a>
		explains the importance of sharing together the struggles and rewards equally.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Time</h4>
	Time can never be earned, repeated, created, or increased. It is only given and used.
	
	<h4>Gifts</h4>
	Grateful for our gifts.	Love is the greatest gift. It is a gift that everyone can give and share. <mark>God is Love.</mark>
	
	<h4>Privileges</h4>
	<p>
		After the understanding of the Gospel, all things received are a privilege from the Father. With such a humble and grateful
		heart, this world will see the Kingdom of God and worry no more about its rights to life.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Believing our Future</h2>
	<p>
		We have hope. Hope that our future does not lie in the hands of men, but is in control by hands of God. We pray with
		the Holy Spirit in seeing the beauty of our future revealed. Our faith anchors us to pray under any circumstances in seeing
		God's plans unfold. Ultimately, all things will glorify God. Until then, we celebrate each victory approached in the 
		name of Jesus Christ.

			<sup>7</sup> Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. <sup>8</sup> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. <sup>9</sup> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. <sup>10</sup> This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. <sup>11</sup> Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <sup>12</sup> No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.

If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
