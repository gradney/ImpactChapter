    Howard University is located north and slightly west of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC. With over thousands of students claiming Christianity on campus, our ministry strongly encourages students to find a church home even if they only plan on staying in DC for their college years. In addition, many parents desire to help their beloved child or children find a church home while attending Howard University.

        2. The following churches are alternatives, but not partnering with us. We don't want to discriminate, but we do want to promote our partnering churches. We'll need to figure out how to do this (maybe create another link to a separate page with the alternative churches and hint at why they're an alternative?).
