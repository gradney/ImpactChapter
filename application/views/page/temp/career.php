	<h1>So you want to get a Job, hunh?</h1>
	<p>We all know that to make a living that we need to get a job. Well, unless we can create jobs. But even until we reach the position of creating jobs, we still need to have a job to pay our bills. Yet to have a job we need to get a job and that starts with your resume and your interviewing skills.</p>
	<h2>Google's Top Qualifiers (by Laszlo Bock) </h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Cognitive Ability</dt>
		<dd>- not about if you can solve a problem rather more about "how" you solve a problem. You need to be able to walk your interviewer through your steps of solving a problem. And solve it. :)</dd>
		<dt>Emergent Leadership</dt>
		<dd>- not about if you were the President of an organization, but rather if you take initiative to step in and help solve issues as well as aware of when to step out and let others solve the issues (i.e. allow others to take charge and follow with full support). You need to have and show leadership qualities and the best way is through humility and service.</dd>
		<dt>Googleyness (Cultural Fit)</dt>
		<dd>- not about if you're similar to another Googler, but what diversity can you add to the culture of the organization to enhance team creativity and collectivity.</dd>
		<dt>Intellectually Humble</dt>
		<dd>- Intelligent, but open, always listening respectfully, and being considerate of other ideas.</dd>
		<dt>Conscientious</dt>
		<dd>- know your environment or surroundings, and think like an owner (take accountability and contribute without being told or asked) instead of an employee (waiting for a manager's orders).</dd>
