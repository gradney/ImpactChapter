          We study the Bible with all intent to disect each message along with the overall message in understanding the truth that it holds. There is no doubt or question that the Gospel itself reveals so much of the way to live a prosperous life, from the cradle to the kingdom, by simply doing one thing - live like Jesus. Yet in order to live like Jesus, we must first understand who this person is. This is the core of our studies. We seek to understand who He is, how we can be like Him, who we are in Him, and showing others who He is. There is no better role model to model our role - in all that we do.
