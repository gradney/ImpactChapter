        <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.25em;">No single person can achieve greatness alone. The same also applies to any ministry.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.25em;"><em>"You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone."</em> - Jethro, Moses' father-in-law <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2018:18" target="_blank">(Exodus 18:18)</a></p>

        <p>This is in context of Moses receiving advise from his father-in-law, Jethro, on governing all of Israel upon the great exodus of Egypt. Moses was governing alone and Jethro respectfully provided advice to Moses stating his leadership and well-being will not sustain. Jethro politely advises Moses to find strong, faithful and teachable leaders throughout Israel to help govern each clan. Through a strong council of "governors" will the nation of Israel sustain as well as Moses and his family.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">These responsibilities listed below provide clarity and boundaries to a graduate who has agreed to commit to a term in advising the coaches and leaders of the current Impact Chapter at Howard University. The chapter is very thankful for each one of our advisors and vow to do our best in listening and applying the guidance and feedback from our advisors. We, the chapter, recognize the huge sacrifice each advisor is making in addition to making strides in his/her next phase in life especially the real first phase of living in the "real-world". Again, thank you very much and we honor your commitment.</p>
