	<p>Why these topics?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Fundamentals - because we realize that we all need to understand the fundamentals which not all churches and organizations teach. Essentially, for a common base.</li>
		<li>Evangelism - because this is the first order given by Jesus in his Great Commission and is the beginning of discipleship.</li>
		<li>Discipleship - because we all must understand our faith, grow in it, and be able to teach others what has been taught to us by Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit.</li>
	</ol>
